Set up a conda environment:
    conda create --name newtons-method-env python=3.12
Activate the environment:
    conda activate newtons-method-env
Double check that python is version 3.12:
    python --version
Ensure that pip is using the most up to date:
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
Ensure pyproject.toml exists and install the package:
If pyproject.toml is present, run:
    pip install -e .
Note: make sure you are in the project root directory and that pyproject.toml exists.
Install pytest and pytest-cov:
(If pytest is not found, install it manually):
    pip install pytest pytest-cov
Test that the code is working with pytest:
    PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=newton tests/
To run the test:
    python tests/test_newton.py
